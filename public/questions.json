        "questions": "How does react works?",
        "answer": "React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. React uses JSX javascript syntax extension for creating react elements which are rendered as plain HTML. React uses virtual dom to identify changes in the main dom using diff algorithm. React divides the ui as isolated reusable pieces of code which is known as components. "

        "questions": "Props Vs State?",
        "answer": "Props are read only objects which are passed from component to component. Props are passed like HTML attributes. Props are unidirectional. Props are immutable so we can not modify them inside the components. State is an updatable structure which is used for storing data. In components states are used as variable which can be updated. It can be changed when user trigger a certain event and it can only be changed inside a component or by component directly."

        "questions": "What are the uses of useEffect beside api fetch?",
        "answer": "useEffect is a react hook which is used for causing side effects in functional component. It is used to fetch data which is not present in code. It can be used to fetch data from local storage or from json file. It can also be used to do a certain action when the app mount and we can set a dependency so that it will run when the dependency is updated."
